### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Stanislav, I'm experienced Quality Assurance engineer with a huge passion for coding.

My current scope of interest is based around:
- Test Automation
- Backend development
- Native Mobile development

ðŸ’š Check out my recent project for <a href="https://github.com/gitstanhub/test-automation-experiment-spotify">Spotify App</a>!

I love Java, and I'm also doing steps forward to master Swift, Kotlin and JS.
