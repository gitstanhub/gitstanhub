### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Stanislav, and I'm an experienced Quality Assurance engineer with a passion for coding.  
I love to write clean code in Java and taking steps towards mastering Swift, Kotlin and JavaScript.

My current scope of interest is focused around:
- Test Automation for API, Web and Mobile
- Backend Development, Unit and Integration tests
- Mobile Development

ðŸ’š Check out my <a href="https://github.com/gitstanhub/test-automation-experiment-spotify">recent project for the Spotify App</a> to get a glimpse of the work I can deliver!
